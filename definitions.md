# Definitions of Taxa in the Taxonomy

In the following table, we describe a taxonomy of images in the [OldVisOnline Dataset](https://github.com/oldvis/dataset).
(The images can be browsed in the [online gallery](https://oldvis.github.io/gallery/).)
We give a definition for each taxon in the taxonomy.

Most definitions are structured as:
`A/An ["visual representation" or a category] that ("commonly") uses [what visual design] to represent [what data (in terms of theme or other properties)]. ([additional characteristics or comments].)`
where "[]" denotes variable content and "()" denotes optional.
We use "commonly" to refer to a characteristic that is not definitive.

Some definitions are structured as:
`A/An ["visual representation" or a category] that [has what characteristics]. ([additional characteristics or comments].)`

For each leaf node (excluding subcategories of non-visualization), we give a link to an example image.
